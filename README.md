# Re:bound  
*"Failure is not the end, but the start of a rebound."*

## 🌱 Overview
**Re:bound** is a social networking service designed to help individuals safely share their experiences of failure, connect with others who have faced similar challenges, and find encouragement to try again.  

When a user posts their story of failure, an **AI-powered warm response** is automatically generated as the first supportive comment — giving immediate comfort, hope, and motivation to rebound.  

## ✨ Key Features
- **Safe Sharing Space**: Post and archive personal failure experiences without stigma.  
- **AI First Response**: Every story receives a kind, supportive AI-generated reply to reduce the fear of being ignored or judged.  
- **Community Support**: Connect with people who have walked a similar path, exchange advice, and encourage each other.  
- **Rebound Motivation**: Tools and resources to inspire the next challenge after failure.  

## 🔧 How It Works (Concept Flow)
1. User submits their failure story.  
2. AI instantly generates a warm supportive message (e.g., *“It must have been tough, but sharing this is already a big step forward.”*).  
3. Community members add their advice, empathy, or stories of similar experiences.  
4. The platform builds a positive cycle of **failure → support → rebound**.  

## 🚀 Vision
Re:bound believes that failure is not the opposite o
# rebound
Re:bound is a social networking service that helps people share failures safely, receive AI-powered encouragement, and rebound with renewed motivation.
